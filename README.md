# personal-website ⦿○•
Prototype for my personal website, all hard-coded using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.\
The project was started as an attempt to self-learn the basic concepts of web development and design, sparked by my interest in JavaScript during a separate personal project involving script injection. With plans to eventually branch out to the use of SQL and PHP to build a more complex site, I have listed below the following languages, concepts, and libraries learnt during the building of the website:

<pre>
⦿ HTML5 - Hypertext Markup Language

⦿ CSS3 - Cascading Style Sheets
  • Basic Layout, Styling, Keyframes, and Animation Events
  • SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics
  • 2D and 3D Transformations
  • CSS and JS Animation Performance/Optimalization
  • CSS Sprites
  • Website Responsiveness (RWD, Media Queries)
  • Cross-Browser Compatibility
  • Sass
  • (in progress) Bootstrap
  
⦿ JavaScript, ECMAScript 6
  • OOP - Object Oriented Programming
  • Callback Functions, Recursion

  • ReactJS
    ○ Building the environment using Babel and Webpack

  • three.js
    ○ Using 3D models to increase interactivity and visuals

  • GSAP TweenMax
    ○ Animating particles and DOM objects to increase interactivity and visuals
